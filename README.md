# Online Library App
This is an Online Library/Book Store where you're able to read books online or download the book pdf file to read offline.


## Build With

- Bootstrap  
- PHP 
- MySQL 


## Authors:

- [@Naeem Witbooi](https://github.com/Naeem-wq)


## Features:

The online book store consists of:

* A Login page
* A sign up page
* Users logging in will either be directed to normal user page or the librarian page, where more access will be given.
* This will depend on the user login credentials and some form validation.
* Normal users will only be able to see available books and download them.
* The Librarian, with administrative rights, will be able to:
* Add books, Authors and Categories
* Delete books, Authors and Categories
* Add books cover images and the book file for the user to download
* As well as delete those cover images and book files
* The librarian also has the right to update and edit any and all files.


## Features to come:

This app is still under development so there's still a few things that needs to be added.
Some now and some things in the near future. These things include:

* Some Animations
* Media Queries
* Adding the actual cover photo's to all the available books
* Adding the book pdf file for the user to download to read offline.
